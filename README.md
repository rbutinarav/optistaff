# OptiStaff: Staffing Optimization Made Easy
_(Project in Early Development Phase)_

Welcome to OptiStaff, an open-source project dedicated to addressing staffing optimization problems. Although we're still in the early development phase, we're excited to share our progress and our vision for the future.

## Project Overview

At OptiStaff, our mission is to simplify the complex task of staffing optimization. Whether you're running a global corporation, a local business, or anything in between, we believe that finding the perfect staff assignment shouldn't be a headache.

Our goal is to develop a suite of tools that can intelligently consider multiple factors such as skills, salaries, language proficiency, and more to determine the best staffing assignments for your unique needs.

## Current Progress

As an early demonstration of our project's potential, we've started with a simple yet relatable example: optimizing staff for a group of restaurants.

This case study showcases how our approach could assign different roles to a pool of candidates while meeting specific constraints. For instance, ensuring that a certain percentage of staff are proficient in English and Italian, hiring staff within a given budget, and ensuring that all roles are filled with the appropriate seniority level.

Our solution leverages the power of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to select the best staff assignments. Although it's a simple example, it's a taste of the potential power that OptiStaff will bring to the table as we continue to develop and expand the project.

## Future Vision

As we progress with our development, we plan to extend OptiStaff to handle a wide variety of staffing scenarios, incorporate more complex constraints and preferences, and provide a user-friendly interface that makes staffing optimization accessible to all.
